# **API Security - External IdP Integration using Okta**

*Duration : 20 mins*

*Persona : API Team/Security*

# **Use case**

You have an API that is consumed by third parties. You want to secure that API using OAuth 2.0 and an external identiy provider such as Okta.
In this lab, we will use Apigee as the OAuth provider to protect the API endpoints using OAuth 2.0. Okta will be used to protect the application end user's identity. We will accomplish this by integrating Okta into the Apigee OAuth proxy, and implement OAuth 2.0 in resource owner / password grant type.
